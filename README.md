# ðŸ“œ Python Sets - A Comprehensive Guide

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Set.ipynb`) that demonstrates various operations on Python sets, including adding, removing, and performing set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts
- âœ… **Unordered Collection** â€“ Sets do not maintain a specific order.
- âœ… **Unique Elements** â€“ Duplicate values are automatically removed.
- âœ… **Mutable** â€“ Elements can be added or removed, but sets themselves are mutable.
- âœ… **Efficient Membership Testing** â€“ Checking if an element exists is optimized.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Creating and accessing set elements
- Adding and removing items
- Performing union, intersection, and difference operations
- Utilizing operators like `|`, `&`, `-`, and `^` for set manipulations
- Handling boolean and numeric overlaps

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage
To use the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliikhan1323/Sets--Python.git
   cd python-sets
   ```
## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Removing duplicates from a dataset.
ðŸ”¹ Performing fast lookups in large datasets.
ðŸ”¹ Set operations in mathematical computations.
